**FolderForge** enables customizable ASCII folder structure diagrams and the creation of complete, downloadable project directories from that structure.

---

## Motivation
I created FolderForge to solve a problem I faced early in my programming journey: visualizing and creating new project directory structures. I found that ASCII diagrams were a great way to understand a project's layout, but creating the folders and files manually was tedious and time-consuming. FolderForge automates this process. It lets you focus on designing the structure, and it handles the rest, generating both the visual diagram and a complete, ready-to-use project directory.

## Quick Start
1.  Go to the **FolderForge** website: [https://iton0.github.io/folderforge/](https://iton0.github.io/folderforge/).
2.  Create your desired folder and file structure in the input area.
3.  Click "Forge" to download your created project directory.
