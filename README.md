## Issue

When planning projects, I often struggled with structuring the file
system. Although ASCII folder structure diagrams helped me visualize
the organization, the manual creation of directories and files using
terminal commands became a hindrance.

## Solution

To simplify filesystem creation, I conceived FolderForge. This tool
not only resolved my challenge but also offers value to developers and
programmers working on substantial projects. FolderForge enables the
generation of ASCII folder structure diagrams and provides the option
to download a zipped version of the converted diagram as a complete
custom filesystem.

## Further Development

I am writing code refactorings right now in [this branch](https://github.com/iton0/folderforge/tree/vue), using Tailwind CSS for simplified styling and Vue.js for increased functionality. I want this project finished by early to mid-May. In addition to codebase optimization, this project attempts to improve user experience by utilizing the robust features of Vue.js and Tailwind CSS for a contemporary, responsive design. As I work on producing a more effective and aesthetically pleasing application, keep an eye out for the upcoming upgrades. Additionally if all goes well, I may merge with main branch.
